APM with dynaTrace dramatically improves the depth of application data accessible within Splunk without scrapping log files. dynaTrace PurePath technology unlocks powerful insights by automatically injecting itself inside the application without any code changes. 

dynaTrace captures and streams in real time, rich end-user transaction information directly into Splunk to dramatically improve the depth of application data accessible within Splunk. Get end-to-end detail starting at the browser including all visitors, all requests, all click paths, 3rd party services and CDNs through to the business transactions on the server side across all tiers. No need to change code or scrape log files. Our integration with Splunk allows users to gain deep application visibility in the context of machine data from all other technology tiers within Splunk. The rich business transaction data captured by Compuware can be analyzed enriched in Splunk, with data from other external business and IT data sources and analyzed for long term user/usage trends, patterns of application activity, forensics and more. - See more at: <a href="http://www.dynatrace.com/en/initiatives/big-data/splunk.html">Dynatrace.com </a>
